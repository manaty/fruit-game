**Enhancing the Fruits Game with Friends**

To introduce more fruits while keeping the number of cards at 42, we'll add three "friends" to each fruit card. These friends are additional fruits displayed on the lower part of the front side of each card. This not only enriches the game but also helps players learn about 126 more fruits, totaling 168 unique fruits in the game.
