Prompt: I want to create a game for my youngest girl Priya that will be 6 on Nov 30 2024. It a card game called "fruits game". Each card is about a fruit. I want to have several games in one that could be interesting for players of all ages. In the cards there would be information about the fruit properties (name, color, place of origin, countries where it grow, importance in industry, in history, in nutition, in medecine, interesting chemicals it contain). We could group it in 7 families (son,daughter, dad, mom, grandfather, grand mother) to play 7 families game, we can also play memory games, we can simply play solo. Please propose a set of rules and the content of each card so the game is fun and instructive.
