For each prompt i used midjourney to create an image.

I started with the citron, making sure the aspect ration match the card template (in 8_game_production/templates).

```
For a 7 families fruits card game, create the cartoon illistration of **Grandfather Citron:** A wise old citron with wrinkled yellow skin, wearing round glasses and holding a wooden cane, smiling gently as he sits in a rocking chair. --ar 41:56
```

then in subsequent prompts i used the [citron image to keep a coherent style](1_prompting.png).
