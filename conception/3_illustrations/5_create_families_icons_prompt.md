for my 7 families card game,
create a python script that uses chatgpt api (model "dall-e-3") to create square icons of the following families

Citrus Family
Berry Family
Stone Fruit Family
Tropical Fruit Family
Pome Fruit Family
Melon Family
Exotic Fruit Family

The script should save the images in a folder named "families_icons" with the following names
Citrus.png
Berries.png
Stones.png
Tropical.png
Pomes.png
Melons.png
Exotic.png

The icons must have black foreground color and white background. 
Make sure the prompt is precise enough so that all icons have same style.
