Note that the program provided by chatGPT was not working, so i had to modify it to make it work.

1. Install necessary packages:
   ```bash
  pip install wikipedia requests 
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 2.1_fruit_img_download.py
   ```

Sometime wikipedia will block the request, just stop the program and execute it again.

Eventually delete the images that you dont like.
